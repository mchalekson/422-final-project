    "Prior research on social media virality highlights the multifaceted nature of content diffusion, emphasizing the interaction between creator-level attributes, content presentation, and audience engagement. Studies grounded in social capital theory demonstrate that creator characteristics such as subscriber count and content history significantly influence engagement outcomes. Other work emphasizes the role of visual attributes, including image memorability and controlled atypicality, in driving attention and interaction, particularly when aligned with platform and category norms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recent machine learning–based studies further show that textual metadata and sentiment signals extracted from titles, descriptions, and comments provide additional predictive power, especially when combined with engagement metrics. Collectively, this literature motivates a multi-view analytical approach that integrates visual, textual, social, and engagement-based features to model YouTube video virality. The present study builds on these findings by empirically evaluating the relative importance of these feature groups within a unified machine learning framework.\n"
